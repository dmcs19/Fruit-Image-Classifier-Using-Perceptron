# Fruit-Image-Classifier-Using-Perceptron
This project implements a simple perceptron-based classifier to distinguish between images of apples and pears. The classifier is trained using color and roundness features extracted from the images. The perceptron adjusts its weights through an iterative training process until the classification error is minimized.
